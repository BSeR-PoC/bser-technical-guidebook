Welcome to the Bi-directional Services e-Referral (BSeR) Technical Guidebook!
=============================================================================

**Bi-directional Services e-Referrals** (BSeR) facilitate extra-clinical aspects of continuity of care by enabling healthcare provider referrals to community programs. This system leverages referring provider “stickiness”, it sends only necessary referral data, and includes the ability to receive feedback from extra-clinical program progress.

Check out the BSeR FHIR IG: Overview page for further information about BSeR.
