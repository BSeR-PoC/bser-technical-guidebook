Example Scenario with Resources
===============================
** TODO: Placeholder. This will provide a step by step walkthrough of the process. Several approaches have been discussed and are listed below. **

```
* Work with Lantana to align example scenario with the FHIR IG example resources. Do not duplicate resources, but contextualize them.
* If maintainable, can use full resources. If not maintainable, should speak generic. Do not include example resources that may be prone to deprecation to avoid confusion.
* If feasible, possibly fold into the FHIR IG directly.
